The platform’s AI technology truly understood what we were looking for in a partner. After months of late-night calls and video chats, we finally met in person, and it was everything we had hoped for. Today, we’re married, and Wedlock helped make it happen.",

The AI matched us based on our shared experiences and values, and from the first conversation, we felt a connection. Now, we’re planning our wedding and couldn’t be happier.",

Wedlock’s AI did a fantastic job of finding someone who matched both our personalities and our long-term goals. We’re now happily engaged!",

I was blown away with her beauty when I saw her pictures for the first time. Also, she matched my expectations like being from the hometown and a working professional, being my most important criteria. I found her profile quite interesting and so sent her a request. Once she accepted it, we had few chat conversations, then phone calls and finally decided to meet up. During our first meet itself we felt very comfortable and I liked her so much. But we still met a few times to understand each other well and better our compatibility. Then, we told our parents about it and took it further.",
